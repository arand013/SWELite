Hello, Here is my Repo for the Forage Software Engineering Lite for JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. 

There is 2 Tasks associated with this Module. 

Task 1:
The RewardsConverter system accepts a cash value and returns the corresponding value in airline miles. The system needs a RewardValue class to function, which represents the correspondence between currencies, be it cash, airline miles, or something else.
